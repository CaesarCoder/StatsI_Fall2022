# Part b:

# Chi square value with degree of freedom 2, Î± = 0.1 is 4.61
# 3.8 < 4.61, the obtained chi-square value did not exceed the critical value
# of 4.61. 
# Therefore, we cannot reject the null hypothesis that soliciting a bribe by 
# police or not is independent from the class of driver.

# Part d: 




# Q2:

WESTB <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kosukeimai/qss/master/PREDICTION/women.csv")

# Part a: 
# Null Hypothesis: There is no correlation between the reservation policy and 
# the number of new or repaired drinking water facilities
# in the villages. 

# Part b:

Reg_Gen_Wat <- lm(water ~ reserved, data = WESTB)
summary(Reg_Gen_Wat)

## how to print the report???


# Part c: 
# The p-value of the coefficient of female is 0.0197, which is lower than 0.05.
# Therefore, we can reject the null hypothesis that there is no correlation 
# between the existence of reservation policy and the number of new or 
# repaired drinking water facilities in the villages at the 95% level. 
# The coefficient of reserved is 9.252, which indicates that when there is a 
# reservation policy in place, we expect to see an average difference by 9.252 
# higher in the number of new or repaired drinking water facilities in 
# the villages.





## increase or decrease?
