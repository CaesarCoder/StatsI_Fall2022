# Part b:

# Chi square value with degree of freedom 2, Î± = 0.1 is 4.61
# 3.8 < 4.61 
# Therefore, we cannot reject the null hypothesis that soliciting a bribe by 
# police or not is independent from the class of driver.

# Part d: 



# Q2:

WESTB <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kosukeimai/qss/master/PREDICTION/women.csv")

# Part a: 
# Null Hypothesis: There is no correlation between Gender of GP leaders and 
# the likelihood of the number of new or repaired drinking water facilities
# in the villages. 

# Part b:

Reg_Gen_Wat <- lm(water ~ female, data = WESTB)
summary(Reg_Gen_Wat)

## how to print the report???


# Part c: 
# The p-value of the coefficient of female is 0.0413, which is lower than 0.05.
# Therefore, we can reject the null hypothesis that there is no correlation 
# between the gender of GP leaders and the likelihood of the number of new or 
# repaired drinking water facilities in the villages at the 95% level. 
# The coefficient of female is 7.864, which indicates that when there is a 
# difference in gender of GP leaders, we expect to see an average difference
# by 7.864 in the number of new or repaired drinking water facilities
# in the villages.





## increase or decrease?
